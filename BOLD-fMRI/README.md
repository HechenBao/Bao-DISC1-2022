1_fMRI_process.R – Used to extract data from raw images, annotate ROIs, measure cross correlation and partial correlation of different ROI-ROI, and compare them compare between groups.

2_corr-value_plot.R – Used to generate correlation heatmaps for cross correlation and partial correlation matrixes.
 
3_p-value_plot.R – Used to generate p-value plots for cross correlation and partial correlation matrixes.

4_node_importance.R – Used to calculate the node importance based on partial correlation matrixes.
